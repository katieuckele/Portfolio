Phytochemistry is an ecologically-relevant phenotype, in that it structures communities at higher trophic levels and is an axis of niche space which may facilitate alpha plant diversity. 
Furthermore, because phytochemistry strongly mediates plant-insect interactions, understanding the evolution of phytochemistry is important to understanding its role in the diversification of plant and insect clades, which together comprise a large proportion of terrestrial diversity.

I have used a ddRAD approach to obtain tens of thousands of SNPs to resolve the Radula phylogeny, and my collaborators have obtained metabolomics data for over 80 Radula accessions. 
To summarize the multidimensional metabolomic traits, we will use a weighted network analysis, which congregates co-occurring NMR resonances into modules which represent scaffolds or functional groups that are similar across mixtures.
We will map these metabolomic traits onto the highly resolved Radula phylogeny to elucidate the macroevolution of phytochemistry in this hyperdiverse plant clade.
