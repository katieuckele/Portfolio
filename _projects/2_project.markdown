By characterizing genetic variation across the geographic range of a species, we can begin to disentangle the various evolutionary and demographic processes operating over various spatial scales in our populations of interest.
The distribution of _Piper arboreum_ throughout Central and South America is interrupted by mountain ranges, unsuitable habitat, and other geographic barriers, making _P. arboreum_ an excellent lineage in which to understand the various ecological and geographic forces contributing to population divergence.

While all individuals in this lineage exhibit the presence of a persistent stipule at the base of the leaf, morphological variation in leaf shape indicate that this species could consist of independently evolved cryptic lineages.
Populations of _Piper arboreum_ were collected from across the geographic range of this species (Costa Rica, Panama, and Brazil) to tease apart the effects of morphological, geographical, and environmental factors on genetic variation.
