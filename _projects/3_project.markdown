_Eois olivacea_ is a species of tropical moth which specializes on a _Piper_ host plants. 
At the Yanayaku Research Station in Ecuador, _Eois olivacea_ has been observed feeding on three distinct _Piper_ species, and populations associated with different _Piper_ hosts exhibit variation in genitalia morphology which may indicate an incipient population divergence and a developing barrier to reproduction. 
We have collected individuals associated with the three _Piper_ hosts and will sequence them with a ddRAD approach to understand how population genetic structure is associated with host association and morphological variation in this tropical moth.
