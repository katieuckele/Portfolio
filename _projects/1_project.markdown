Traditionally, hybrid zones have been used as windows into the process of divergence and speciation; however,hybrid zones are also powerful natural laboratories, where recombined genotypes and replicated instances of hybridization provide the raw materials to understand extended community and ecosystem consequences.
Three closely-related juniper taxa occur in arid regions of the Sierra Nevada, Great Basin, and Colorado plateau, and hybridize in western Nevada, where their distributions converge. 
Using a ddRAD sequencing approach, we have elucidated patterns of hybridization across the recombinant landscape and have begun to ask how environmental and phytochemical variation may be linked to admixture and genetic variation.

I have used a ddRAD approach to elucidate the patterns of admixture across the hybrid zone, and will implement model-free and model-based methods to better understand the roles of environment and geography in shaping patterns of genetic variation across the landscape. 
I am also collaborating with students and faculty in the UNR chemistry department to characterize phytochemical variation across the hybrid landscape to better understand the links among genetic, environmental, and phenotypic variation in these foundational tree species.
