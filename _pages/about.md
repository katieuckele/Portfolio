Welcome to my website. I'm a graduate student in the [Parchman lab](https://parchmanlab.com/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Nevada, Reno, where I am investigating the evolutionary context of plant-insect interactions and their role in generating patterns of diversification. 

With the advance of next-generation genome sequencing technologies, partnered with advances in metabolomic analysis, it is possible to finely-characterize both the genetic and phytochemical landscape, as well as obtain unparalleled resolution phylogenetic relationships and patterns of phytochemical evolution. 

Given these advances in technology and analytics, we can test long-standing hypotheses of how variation at phenotypic, genetic, and geographic scales is related and contributes to the dynamics of biotic interactions.
